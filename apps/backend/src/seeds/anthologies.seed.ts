      'I’ll Light Up My Own Sky is a collection of college essays written by graduates from 2021-2025. ' +
      'While their stories explore common themes, each essay remains infused with the distinct voice of its author. ' +
      'In this collection, readers will come across nuanced perspectives on home, obstacles large and small, the value of building relationships with mentors, and young people reckoning with the age-old question: Who am I now, and who might I become? ' +
      'As they navigate the next chapter of their lives, students remind readers to remain open-minded in the face of newness, resilient in the face of struggle, self-empowered in the face of negativity, and hopeful even when it seems impossible.',
