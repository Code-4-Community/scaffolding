## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve frontend`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Running tasks

To run just the frontend (port 4200):

```
nx serve frontend
```

To run just the backend (port 3000):

```
nx serve apps/backend
```

To run both the frontend and backend with one command:

```
nx run-many -t serve -p apps/frontend apps/backend
```

## Other commands

Run `git submodule update --remote` to pull the latest changes from the component library

When cloning the repo, make sure to add the `--recurse-modules` flag to also clone the component library submodule (e.g. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Code-4-Community/scaffolding.git` for the `scaffolding` repo)
